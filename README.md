🦉 Night Watcher

Something stirs in the shadows… the Night Watcher owl only comes out at night!

🌙 How to Find It

Travel to spooky spots at night (like the Valentine Graveyard).

Get close enough and the owl will appear in a shimmer of magic!

Don’t wander too far — moving 10+ units away makes it vanish.

✨ Interact & Get Rewards

Approach the owl and interact.

Hear a mysterious hoot… just for you!

Get random rewards like water, gold, or other surprises.

⏱ Tips

Owl stays for 20 seconds (default), then flies off.

Cooldown prevents immediate retriggers — patience pays!

Other players can still encounter their own owl.

🔮 Remember

The owl watches, whispers, and rewards… if you’re clever enough to find it.
Keep your ears open and your curiosity sharper!
